Zweinflugger!
=============

Attempt at a crappy frameworky thingy for LÃ¶ve2d


Oh no! Aliens! Lucky we got these prototype aircraft we stole from the germans in WWII!

Two players on one keyboard. Player one uses WASD (or ZQSD for azerty) and player two uses the arrows. As long as one Zweinflugger is alive, a downed Zweinflugger can ressurect and return to battle. Shoot down as many aliens as you can!
